//! #1976 — per-path WRITE-grant enforcement for the native file tools.
//!
//! A [`WritePathGrant`] is the octos-agent realisation of a fleet task's
//! `fs: { write: [...], create_only }` grant (`octos_fleet::WorkerGrant::
//! write_paths` — this crate deliberately has no `octos-fleet` dependency, so
//! the host-side mapping lives in `octos-fleet-worker::closed_registry`,
//! mirroring how `FsGrant` maps to `EffectivePermissions`). Bound to
//! `write_file` / `edit_file` via their `with_write_grant` builders, it makes
//! the fence kernel-side: a write outside the allowlist is a typed refusal,
//! not a polite request the model may ignore.
//!
//! # Matching contract (must stay aligned with the sandbox translation)
//!
//! Patterns are workspace-relative with `*` / `?` wildcards confined to ONE
//! path segment (`literal_separator`); `**`, `[...]`, `{...}` are rejected —
//! the v1 syntax is deliberately the intersection that this globset matcher
//! and the macOS SBPL regex translation
//! (`crate::sandbox::macos` `write_allow_globs`) express IDENTICALLY, so the
//! tool layer and the shell sandbox can never disagree about what is granted.
//! The same rules are validated fleet-side at plan time
//! (`octos_fleet::validate_write_path_pattern`); re-validating here is
//! defense-in-depth for programmatic constructions.
//!
//! # Symlink safety (security round — ancestor-swap TOCTOU)
//!
//! The allowlist decision and the actual open MUST target the same resolved
//! object. An earlier design canonicalized the path for the CHECK but the
//! tools then opened the LEXICAL path — so an attacker who swapped a checked
//! real directory (`cards/`) for a symlink between check and open escaped
//! (leaf `O_NOFOLLOW` guards only the leaf, never ancestors). The fix:
//! [`check_write`](WritePathGrant::check_write) does a purely LEXICAL
//! allowlist match and returns the workspace-relative path, and the write goes
//! through [`open_confined`] — a component-wise `O_NOFOLLOW` `openat` walk from
//! the workspace-root dirfd. A symlinked (or swapped-to-symlink) ancestor
//! fails `ELOOP`/`ENOTDIR` at its OWN component, so the opened object is
//! provably the one the allowlist matched. `create_only` is `O_CREAT|O_EXCL`
//! on that same walked leaf; a fenced edit reads and rewrites ONE handle.
