//! Flag-gated windowed `read_file` enforcement (#1638). **Off by default.**
//!
//! Armed via `OCTOS_READ_WINDOW=1`. When armed, `read_file` returns at most
//! [`WINDOW_MAX_LINES`] lines and at most [`WINDOW_MAX_BYTES`] bytes of
//! formatted output — whichever limit is hit first — with a footer naming the
//! limit that fired, the range actually returned, the file's totals, and the
//! exact next call. A `byte_offset`/`byte_limit` raw mode pages content that
//! line offsets cannot reach (single lines larger than the window). Unarmed
//! behaviour is byte-identical to before this module existed.
//!
//! ## Parameter provenance
//!
//! The 2000-line half is the `pi` harness's field-tested default, verbatim
//! (`truncate.ts: DEFAULT_MAX_LINES = 2000`). An earlier 500-line/24KiB
//! proposal was rejected as too aggressive — 57.4% of this repo's files are
//! ≤500 lines, so ~43% of reads would have paged.
//!
//! The byte half adapts pi's 50KB (`DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES = 50 * 1024`) to two
//! local facts pi does not have:
//!
//! 1. Our output carries a line-number gutter, so the bytes that actually
//!    enter the context are the FORMATTED bytes, and that is what this budget
//!    counts (the execution loop's cap counts `String::len()` of the same
//!    string).
//! 2. That loop cap — `octos_core::tool_output_limit("read_file")` = 50,000 —
//!    is a blind head/tail backstop (#2124). The whole point of an advising
//!    window is that the tool's own cut is the ONLY cut, so the window plus
//!    its footer must provably fit under the loop cap. 50 * 1024 = 51,200
//!    does not. 48 KiB (49,152) plus a [`FOOTER_RESERVE`]-byte footer does.
//!
//! A tripwire test pins `WINDOW_MAX_BYTES + FOOTER_RESERVE <=
//! tool_output_limit("read_file")` so lowering the loop budget cannot
//! silently re-expose windowed reads to the blind backstop, and every armed
//! return path is clamped to `WINDOW_MAX_BYTES + FOOTER_RESERVE` at RUNTIME
//! (not a `debug_assert`, which release builds drop). None of the armed
//! returns interpolates unbounded caller input — path spellings can be
//! arbitrarily long, so model-facing messages clamp them.
//!
//! ## Why raw byte paging instead of a shell fallback
//!
//! pi's answer to a line larger than the window is a `sed | head -c` shell
//! fallback. That is self-defeating under OUR constraints, twice over: the
//! shell tool's own output cap is 30,000 bytes
//! (`octos_core::tool_output_limit("shell")`), so the advised `head -c 49152`
//! can never arrive intact; and the loop sanitizer redacts exactly the
//! content giant lines are made of (base64 data URIs, long hex —
//! `sanitize.rs`), so what survives the cap is then redacted. Hence the
//! in-tool `byte_offset`/`byte_limit` mode: raw slices, no gutter, footer
//! naming the next `byte_offset`, and the bytes count toward the same
//! coverage ledger as line reads.
//!
//! ## The view ledger: fail-closed overwrite protection
//!
//! The second half of this module tracks, per `(session, path)`, how much of
//! the file the model has actually been shown — so `write_file` (armed) can
//! refuse to reconstruct a file wholesale from a view the model does not
//! have. The slides workflow mandates exactly read → rebuild → `write_file`,
//! and its prompt forbids the patch tools, so this guard is the only thing
//! between a windowed read and a truncated script.
//!
//! The rule is **fail-closed** (codex review of the first draft, which was
//! fail-open on four axes): overwriting an EXISTING file larger than
//! [`WINDOW_MAX_BYTES`] requires a COMPLETE mark from THIS session; no entry
//! means refuse-and-read-first. Absence being the refusing state makes a
//! process restart safe by construction (the model must re-read, which is
//! correct anyway), makes bounded eviction safe (evicting can only cause a
//! re-read, never an unseen overwrite), and closes the giant-first-line hole
//! (the advice branch records nothing, and nothing now means NO). Files at
//! or under the byte window can still be blind-overwritten exactly as today
//! — a file that size is returned whole by a single unbounded read, so there
//! is no partial-view illusion to protect against; but once ANY armed read
//! recorded a view of it, that record is honoured (a partial or tainted or
//! stale view refuses regardless of size).
//!
//! Coverage is tracked in BYTES — one coordinate system for line-mode reads
//! (converted to their byte spans) and raw byte-mode reads, so paging past a
//! giant line stitches naturally. The mark is a contiguous-from-byte-0
//! high-water line keyed by an epoch of `(mtime, size, ctime, inode)` on Unix
//! (`(mtime, size)` off-Unix): any epoch change resets coverage to the new
//! read alone, and `write_file` re-validates the recorded epoch against the
//! CURRENT file at write time, so a file replaced after reading refuses as
//! stale instead of trusting dead coverage. A same-mtime-same-size IN-PLACE
//! rewrite IS detected on Unix — ctime advances on any write and userspace
//! cannot roll it back — and a rename-over swap is detected by the inode.
//! (Off-Unix the scheme falls back to `(mtime, size)`, a documented weaker
//! guarantee for this Unix-primary flag.)
//!
//! A view only counts if the model actually received the bytes: the recorded
//! output is checked against `sanitize_tool_output` (the exact function the
//! execution loop applies afterwards), and a view the sanitizer would alter
//! is recorded TAINTED — the epoch can then never reach COMPLETE, because a
//! whole-file rewrite would replace redacted content with redaction
//! placeholders. Reads that fit no ledger (metadata unavailable) record an
//! epoch-less entry that likewise never completes.
//!
//! The ledger is a process-global map, NOT threaded through `ToolContext`
//! state: the guard is a data-loss check and must hold on every entry path,
//! including legacy `Tool::execute` calls that carry a zero context (the
//! strong file-version ledger on `ToolContext` is optional and absent on those
//! paths, which is why it was not reused). Entries are keyed by
//! `(parent_session_key, canonical path)`: one session's COMPLETE never
//! authorizes another's, and canonicalization keeps `read_file` and
//! `write_file` agreeing over path aliases (`/var` vs `/private/var`). The map
//! is bounded at [`MAX_LEDGER_ENTRIES`] (oldest-recorded evicted first — safe,
//! because absence refuses).
//!
//! R4 (codex round 3): a missing/empty session key is reachable in production
//! (agents default to `None`; FFI and fleet workers; plain CLI chat without
//! `--goals`), so an empty key must NOT share a bucket with another keyless
//! task. Empty-session reads and writes therefore record NOTHING — a keyless
//! task can never establish COMPLETE, so the write guard fails closed for its
//! over-window overwrites (`record_view`/`note_full_write` are the single
//! enforcement point; the guard adds only a clearer keyless message). This is
//! deliberately NOT the #2126 probe's `LAST_READ` map — that one is
//! observe-only, keyed to the probe's own env flag and 500/24KiB canary, and
//! its per-path counters are `cfg(test)`.
