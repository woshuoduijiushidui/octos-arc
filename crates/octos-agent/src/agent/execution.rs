//! Tool execution: dispatching tool calls with hooks and timeout handling.
//!
//! # Batch admission (M8.8, #1766)
//!
//! Each turn of the agent loop receives a batch of tool calls from the LLM.
//! Before M8.8 every call in a batch fired in parallel, which races when a
//! mutating tool (shell, write_file, edit_file, diff_edit, save_memory) sits
//! next to a reader in the same batch. The executor now consults
//! [`crate::tools::Tool::concurrency_class`] for every call and picks one of
//! three admission strategies:
//!
//! - **All-Safe batch** — the classic path. Every call is [`ConcurrencyClass::Safe`]
//!   (read-only, side-effect-free). The executor spawns each call as a detached
//!   task and aggregates via `futures::join_all`, preserving call order.
//! - **All-Exclusive batch** — the M8.8 path. Every call reports
//!   [`ConcurrencyClass::Exclusive`]. The executor runs calls serially in LLM
//!   call order. On the first error (including hook denials and panics), the
//!   remaining peers are skipped and each receives a synthetic
//!   "cancelled due to sibling error" [`Message`] so the LLM still sees a
//!   result for every `tool_call_id`.
//! - **Mixed batch** — the #1766 path (previously such batches fell back to
//!   fully-serial). Phase 1 runs every Safe call in parallel, with the same
//!   spawn/aggregate shape as the all-Safe path; phase 2 then runs the
//!   Exclusive calls serially in LLM call order. Aggregated results are
//!   reassembled in the ORIGINAL LLM call order, so downstream consumers see
//!   the same 1:1 `tool_call_id` mapping as the other two strategies.
//!
//! ## Mixed-batch semantics (#1766, pinned by the `mixed_batch_*` tests)
//!
//! - **Visibility** — Safe calls observe the PRE-batch state. A Safe read the
//!   LLM listed AFTER an Exclusive mutation still runs in phase 1, i.e.
//!   BEFORE that mutation, and does NOT see the sibling's write. (Before
//!   M8.8 the two raced nondeterministically; under the M8.8 serial fallback
//!   the read saw the write. The phased pipeline pins a deterministic
//!   reads-before-writes snapshot, regardless of list position.)
//! - **Cascade, phase 1 → phase 2** — any Safe-call failure that carries the
//!   cascade bit (real execution errors, hook denials, panics, timeouts —
//!   everything except a no-side-effect [`crate::tools::ToolInputError`],
//!   #1690) cancels the ENTIRE Exclusive phase, position-independently: no
//!   mutation runs after a failed read. Cancelled Exclusive calls receive
//!   the same synthetic "cancelled due to sibling error" [`Message`] as the
//!   serial path.
//! - **Cascade, inside phase 2** — identical to the all-Exclusive path: the
//!   first cascading failure cancels the REMAINING Exclusive peers (in LLM
//!   order). Phase-1 Safe results are never retroactively cancelled by a
//!   phase-2 failure: they already completed, are side-effect-free by
//!   definition, and their real outputs are strictly more information for
//!   the LLM than a synthetic cancellation.
//! - **Approvals / human-input determinism** — approval-gated tools (shell,
//!   edit_file, write_file, …) are all Exclusive, so their in-tool approval
//!   prompts fire one at a time, in LLM call order, during phase 2. Phase 1
//!   fully joins before phase 2 starts, so a human-wait Safe tool
//!   (`ask_user_question`) can never overlap an approval prompt. The
//!   per-turn requester bridges (`TOOL_APPROVAL_CTX`, `USER_QUESTION_CTX`)
//!   are captured per call in `spawn_tool_task`, exactly as before — the
//!   phase split does not change how they propagate.
