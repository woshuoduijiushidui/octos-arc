///   routing was successfully built (more than one provider). Owned
///   here because the per-profile metrics exporter wants a typed
///   handle, not a `dyn` provider.
/// - **`credentials`** — resolved API keys / secrets keyed by env-var
///   name. Populated from `profile.config.env_vars` via the keychain;
///   passed to MCP server spawns and plugin invocations on the session
///   side.
/// - **`skills_dir`** — the per-profile plugin directory
///   (`~/.octos/profiles/<id>/data/skills/`), if it exists. Used at
///   bootstrap time to register profile-scoped skills into
///   [`Self::tool_specs`].
/// - **`plugin_env_template`** — the env-var pairs (e.g.
///   `OCTOS_PROFILE_ID`, `OCTOS_VOICE_DIR`) every plugin spawn for
///   this profile should inherit. Sessions clone this into their own
///   plugin spawns; if a session needs to add session-scoped vars it
///   does so on top of this template.
/// - **`tool_policy`** — the profile's allow/deny tool policy. The
///   policy is *applied per session* (after the session clones
///   [`Self::tool_specs`]) so policy edits don't require rebuilding
///   the base registry.
/// - **`default_sandbox`** — the sandbox config every session
///   inherits unless it explicitly overrides via
///   [`super::SessionRuntime::sandbox`].
/// - **`tool_specs`** — the base [`ToolRegistry`] template. It has
///   builtins registered, plugins loaded, MCP agents wired, the LRU
///   pin set applied — *but no workspace bound*. Sessions clone this
///   and call `with_workspace_root` to get a workspace-bound registry.
///   This is the M11 fix for the multi-tenant base-registry leak
///   codex flagged on PR #868.
/// - **`memory`** / **`memory_store`** — the per-profile
///   [`EpisodeStore`] (redb at `<data_dir>/episodes.redb`) and
///   [`MemoryStore`] (MEMORY.md, daily notes). Memory is profile-
